# Yew Bootstrap Examples

## How to run

The examples are built with [trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk) which you can install with the following command:

```bash
cargo install --locked trunk
```

Running an example is as easy as running a single command in the appropriate directory:

```bash
# move into the directory of the example you want to run
# In this case it's the todomvc example
cd examples/basics

# build and serve the example
trunk serve --release
```
